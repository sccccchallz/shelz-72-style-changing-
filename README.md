# shelz-72-style-changing-
A keyboard project by shelz
This is a 72 keys keyboard, I have used this layout for a bit, it is quite good, however, I do not have enough time to build a pcb using a chip that is over 1000hz, 
which means that this is only for working now, but not too much lag, it is acceptable.
For the case, I used both Acrylic and LEGO, both of them are good. it you like a softer touch, you cou enlarge the hole by the side of the pcb to match perfectly on 
the lego, when I made this, I did not get the actual size of the LEGO, so the hole is for screws only currently on my handed version.
